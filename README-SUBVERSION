Pyff has moved from SVN to GIT!
===============================

The old googlecode repository is no longer in use. The new repository is

  http://github.com/venthur/pyff

You can still use SVN in read-only mode with the git repositoryh if you must,
but I encourage you to use git instead!

How to use SVN with the git repository:
=======================================

Do the initial checkout:

  svn checkout https://svn.github.com/venthur/pyff

Basic work cycle:

  # update your repository
  svn update

  # your actual work..
  <edit files>
  svn add
  svn delete
  svn copy
  svn move

  # examine your changes
  svn status
  svn diff
  svn revert

  # create a patch and send it to me
  svn diff > my-changes.patch

The last step is necessary since you cannot commit changes with SVN into the
git repository. So you collect all the changes in one file and send it to me.
